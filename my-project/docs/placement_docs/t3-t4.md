# T3-T4 Placement Instruction

For T3-T4 electrode placement, locate the pre-auricular notch (the small indentation or crease just in front of the ear). The electrodes should be positioned approximately **1 inch above the pre-auricular notch or ear crease**[1].

- For individuals with very large heads, place the electrodes closer to **1.5 inches** above the notch.
- For children or individuals with smaller heads, use **less than 1 inch** above the notch for accurate placement[1].

## Placement Example

- **T4 Example:**  
  Place the green electrode about 1 inch up from the pre-auricular notch on the right side of the head (T4 position)[1].

## Symmetry

When placing both T3 (left side) and T4 (right side) electrodes, ensure they are **symmetrical**â€”both should be at the same height above their respective pre-auricular notches for balanced and accurate recording[1].
