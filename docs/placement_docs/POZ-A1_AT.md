# POZ-A1 Alpha Theta Placement Instruction

POZ is located halfway between PZ (the top back flat spot of the head) and OZ (about 1 inch above the inion). This means POZ is slightly lower and further back on the head compared to PZ.

Yellow wires are used for the PO line (PO3, POZ, PO4).

## When to Use POZ Placement

- POZ is typically used for Alpha Theta training.
- Use your Alpha Theta Client ID for this protocol.
- For other eyes-closed (EC) training, use your usual 1-channel ID.

---

## Session Setup

- Set the threshold to **3x the average** to accommodate slow brain waves rising in amplitude.
- The session should be done **eyes closed**. Recline or use an eye mask for comfort.

---

## Feeding Wires into the Amplifier

- **3 wires are needed:** Red, Black, and Green (ground)
    - POZ: Red
    - A1 (left ear): Black
    - Ground: Green (clip on either ear)
- Clips can be placed anywhere on the ear, but if using two clips on the same ear, ensure they do not touch to avoid mechanical artifact.
