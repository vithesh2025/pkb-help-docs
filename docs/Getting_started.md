**If you don’t see an assignment:**  
- Let us know your main priorities for the session and reach out for guidance.

    - Click on the client already on the computer (highlighted in blue) and click **OK**.
- Choose the appropriate protocol:
    - **ClientID-1ch** for single-channel sets
    - **2ch** for dual-channel sets

## 4. Electrode Placement

- Attach all electrodes/leads to the head as per your assignment.
    - Use a pea-sized amount of Ten20 paste for secure placement.

- Plug electrodes into the amplifier:
    - For single-channel training: use 3 electrodes (Red, Black, and Green/Ground).
        - Example: (C4-A1) — C4 Red, A1 Black, Ground (A2/opposite ear)

## 5. Begin Session and Select Game

- Use function keys:
    - **Fn F9**: Autoscale (press a few times)
    - **Fn F11**: Set reward % (press a few times)
    - **Fn F5**: Begin session
- **Spacebar** toggles between game display and traces display.

    - Press **Spacebar** to return to traces display (if using a single monitor).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, reach out on the Slack channel—upload pictures of the full signal/trace screen for support.
- If EEGer isn’t working or you get a black screen when selecting a game, close EEGer (Escape, then close) and relaunch.
