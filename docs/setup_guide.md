## 1. Refresh Your Noggin Chart / Peak Portal

- Access your protocol assignment (workout) for the day via the Noggin Chart or Peak Portal.
- Edit and date your assignment, then click **Update** to save.
- Use the desktop shortcut on your Peak computer or go to [bit.ly/peakportal](https://bit.ly/peakportal).

- [Video: Navigating the Portal](#)

**If you don't see an assignment:**  
- Tell us your main priorities to address and reach out for support.
- If the last set offered obvious benefits, you may repeat it and let us know.
- If you haven't done a survey since your last set, it's helpful to complete one while waiting to help us customize your sessions.

## 2. Hardware Setup

- Plug in your EEGer Dongle and Wiz Amplifier.
- Open the EEGer software.

## 3. Set Up Your Protocol in EEGer

- Select your client and click on a client already on the computer (highlight blue), then click **OK**.
- Choose the appropriate protocol:
  - **ClientID-1ch** for single channel
  - **2ch** for dual sets
  - **AT** for Alpha Theta sets
- Plan the session to match your Noggin Portal assignment.
- If selecting a custom plan, press **SAVE/OK** immediately after selection, then open **PLANNING** again to make any adjustments.

## 4. Head Setup

- Apply all electrodes/leads to the head as per your assignment.
- Ensure electrodes are secure with sufficient Ten20 paste (about a pea-sized amount).

## 5. Connect Electrodes to Amplifier

- For single channel training, use 3 electrodes per the colored sockets:
  - Red and Black + unnamed Green/Ground to reduce noise.
  - Example: (C4-A1) — C4 Red, A1 Black, and a ground (likely A2/opposite ear).

## 6. Begin Session and Select Game

- Ensure the top raw signal trace looks good after initializing (no "angry caterpillars," flat line, or big vertical lines).
- Set threshold to ~2x the average (use the down arrow key to highlight -/+ to adjust).
- Press **Enter** to remove highlight.
- Use:
  - **Fn F9** (autoscale)
  - **Fn F11** (set reward %) — press each a few times
  - **Fn F5** to begin
- Press **Spacebar** to toggle between game display and traces display.

## 7. Segment Management

- At the end of a segment, the game will pause.
- Press **Spacebar** to return to traces display if on a single monitor.
- Always switch wires in the amplifier to the next segment.
- Press **Fn F5** once to load the next segment or stage, then repeat:
  - Set threshold, press Enter, Fn F9, Fn F11, Fn F5.

## 8. End of Session

- Hit **Escape** and close the EEGer software.
- Remove visible paste with a tissue, and clean any remaining paste from hair (provided wipes are fine for electrodes, but dry them before storing).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter difficulties, reach out on the Slack channel! The Slack app makes it easy to see alerts and upload pictures.
- If you are unsure how to correct an issue, take a picture of the full signal/trace screen and upload it to the channel.
- If EEGer isn’t working normally, or you get a black screen when selecting a game, close out of EEGer (Escape then close) and relaunch.
